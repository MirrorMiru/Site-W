            <h2>KENOVA</h2>
            <h4>
                Kenova is a large planet (about 2x the size of earth), and is incapible of rotation. Unlike earthm, Kenova dose not spin around its axis so the portion that faces the sun is a hot desert where it is always day, and the other side is a ever dark tundra. The center strip called "the tilight zone" has a climate simmilar to the rainforests of earth with lush vegitation and a high humidity.
                Kenova is populated by Kenovians, a very old race who are described in deatil later in this page. Kenova has existed for far longer than earth and its enviormewnt has drastically chnaged over the years. Kenova has one moon, a small satilite covered in jungles that was once populated by a tribal race of snake-people. 
            </h4>
            <h2>THE KENOVIANS</h2>
            <h5>Kentre</h5>
            <h4>
                The Kentre (ken-treh) are the dominant subrace of Kenovians, with a higher population and larger influence. The Kentre population as of Sammy's birth was 9 billion with only about 1 billion living of Kenova
                with the rest living on Kaar'ka. That number would stay relativley stagnant even after Sammy's death and far into the future. The Kentre are native to "the twilight zone" and have developed an adavnaced 
                technological society. The modern Kentre has orange-ish skin, bright blonde hair, no hair anywhere but their head, claws (that they often cut) and the Males are 5 feet tall while females are 7 feet tall on average.
                They wear "uniforms", Baggy beige pants made of "paper-cloth" a material that feels like cloth but has paper like properties (crumples), but is very sturdy. Brown or maroon boots.
                a beige or light brown shirt with a darker brown vest. A maroon necktie or bow. And a red hairband that keeps the long, straightly cut hair in a bun or ponytail. 
                <br>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year ~100 I) Going back to prehistory. The earliest Kenovians looked simmilar to the deathclaw from fallout, the Females were 9 feet tall while the males where about 6 feet tall. They had large lizard like tails, using them as a third leg as they were bipedal. Their arms were well developed and had 4 clawed fingers and a thumb. They were grey-orange and covered with small scales. Despite this appearance
                Kenovians were warm blooded mammals who gave live birth. The males had "poison glands" and could inject paralizing venom using their long "fangs". The other teeth for both genders were sharp and of equal size, a feature that still remains in modern day kenovians though the poison glands have long since lost usability.
                The glands in modern day are the equivelant of an apendix in humans although males stil have their hollow fangs. In this time, Kenovians were in their "stone age" and lived in small tribes that often fought with each other.
                Both genders would hunt and many land animals would go extinct due to early Kenovians dominance as apex predators.
                <br>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year ~200,000 I) By their "bronze age" Kenovians (Kentre) began to shift in appearance as scales were replaced with skin and their faces began to look more human than animal. It is theorized 
                that this "evolution" was caused by outside radiation or tomfoolery by a advanced humanoid race, though this is not confirmed. In this peroid, Kenovians began to biuld towns although their social strucre was
                still tribal and their society stemmed from war.
                <br>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year ~300,000 I) This period of time in Kenovain history is often called "the steel age". Kenovians had almost entierly become humanoid, loosing their tails and looking almost the same as modern Kenovians. The females were
                now on average 8 feet tall and the males were still 6 feet tall. Kentre hair was a bright yellow that may or may not glow under a black light. They have no other hair on their body, only on their head, not even the small hairs
                that grow on our arms and legs are present on ither gender. The hair they do have though grows incredibly fast and they would often wrap themselves in it instaid of clothing. 
                <br>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                During the steel age, towns were replaced by cities and "unions" were formed, leading into the first industreal age. In the steel Age, the tribes were replaced with 
                "kingdoms", called Kerrikes (Kare-rai-kz). The Kentre would also begin to circumnavigate thir planet, exploring the tundra and desert. In the desert they met the Kensaa (Ken-sah) 
                who they almost entierly wiped out because Kenovians were incredibly racist and xenophobic. 
                <br>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year ~400,000 I) This is around the time of the first Kenovian Industreal Age, when kenovians finally discovered steam power and mass production. By this point, many of the Kerrmasts (Kare-mah-st-z), the 
                Kenovian monarchs, were replaced with councils. Unions would form into compaines and the stock market arose. This is around the time Kenovians began to wear clothes.

            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year ~450,000 I) The Heat. The Kenovian star, Kazamet (Kah-zah-met) began to slowly expand and the planet wou,d start to heat up.

            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year 500,000 I)(aka. year 0 II) The birth of the catalyst. In one of the last monarchies of Kenova, a prince was born. He would become the first "dictator" of Kenova. He managed to conquer the entire 
                Twilight Zone and would begin a policy of rapid industrealization.
                <br>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year 180 II) The death of the catalyst. In the ~160 years that he ruled, the catalyst would bring Kenova into the second industreal age. Kenovaions began to look exactly like their moderm counterparts.
                Feamles were ~7 feet tall and males were ~5 feet tall, notably shorter than their ancestors. The modern Kenovain "uniform" was also established. By year 180, kenovians were in the same technological
                realm as humas were in the early 1900s.
                <br>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year 1180 II) The space age. In this time, Kenovians would biuld the first spacehisps and conquer their moon, stripping it of resources and killing the natives because they were still racist. technologically they were simmilar to us in the 1950s.
                <br>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year 2500 II) The true modern age. Kenova would become notably hotter, the desert was ~150 degrees F. Kenova would begin to run out of resources. Gas prices were sky high and the enviorment was thrashed. Most animals were extinct. Many migrated to the moon. 
                Kenovains were technologically equivelant to us as of 2010.
                <br>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                (year 2600 II) The liberal revolution. The Kenvoian dicatorship was overthrown by a democartic liberal revolutionary party. The councill was restablished and the first president was elected.

                population is likley around 10 billion. Ancient history is seldom remebered. The kenovian star became a supernova and nothing remains of the old system. Sammy's desndants
                likley roam the universe though do not know of their now ancient ancestor.  
            </h4>
            <h5>Kensnna</h5>
            <h4>
                Arising around the same time as the Kentre, the Kensnna lived in caves in the snowy tundra of Kenova. They never developed outside their stone age but during the great evacuation, they proved
                to be capible and even eager to sociaslize with the Kentre, seeing no differnece in the two races. The Kensnna have thicker pale skin despite having the same blood color and typeings.
                Their skin also emits a faint blue glow due to the glowing blue mushrooms that make up for a majority of their diet. They are about a foot taller than their Kentre relatives. They have thick black hair that grows not only
                on their head, but they also have armpit and pubic hair, though none have facial, limb, or nose hair. They have bright red eyes and limited night vision. They have very sharp hearing. Another sharp
                thing is their long claws. 
            </h4>
            <h5>Kensaa</h5>
            <h4>
                The Kensaa are a now extinct Kenovain race who eveolved at around the same pace as the Kentre but were phiscally weaker and less populous. The males were around 4 feet tall and the females were 6 feet tall.
                They had short brown hair and hair on their feet. They retained some brown scales around their sides, back, and neck. They even still had tails. They had tan skin and lived nomadic and peaceful lives.
                As they were compatibe with other Kenovains, some Kentre had secret relationships with the Kensaa and some Kensaa genes exist even today though it is too small of a margin to cause any notable change.

            <h4>
                Kenovian society differed drastically of their home planet and on Kaar'ka.
            </h4>
                <br>
                <h5>KENOVA</h5>
             <h4>
                Kenova is often seen as the "conservative" planet due to its older population. This "conservatism" is NOT THE SAME as conservatism on earth. Kenovains on Kenova
                are very connected to their tarditions and culture, wearing their traditional uniforms, celebrating ancient hollidays, and speaking Kenovian as their main language.
                Education is far weaker on Kenova and most jobs are "blue collar". Due to the small amount of residential areas, most Kenovains are factory workers. Kenova is a poor and
                antisocial planet, never engaging with the Intergalactic Government. 
                <br>
                Kenovains on Kenova have no family life and love is virtually nonixistant. Kenovains do not feel love and do not raise their kids. Every 5 years there is a breeding season where 
                Kenovains breed with whoever is compatible (as long as they are over 20). This is seen as casual and more of a obligation or chore as nither gender feel pleasure during intercorse. In addition, a Kenovian fetus
                is fully developed in about 5 months and causes no pain to the mother. Despite only the females birthing, both female and male sprem can impregnate. The Kenovain age of consent is 20, but they do not
                engage in intercorse until 25. 
            </h4>
            <h5>KAAR'KA</h5>
                <h4>
                Kaar'ka has fully embraced Intergalactic culture and is far more "human" in nature. The main language is Intergalactic as opposed to Kenovian and Kaar'ka follows the fassion
                and social trends of the greater Intergalactic world. Intergalactic pop culture has a large effect on Kaar'kan culture. Unlike Kenovas industreal areas and suburbs, Kaar'ka is dotted in gilstening cyberpunk cities
                and has a busseling economy. 
                <br>
                There is some tension between the two planets after Kaar'ka declared independance, severly hurting Kenova's economy. Kenova also sees the Kaar'kan Kenovians as alien to their culture.
                <br>
                The Kenovians of Kaar'ka follow many of the parenting and relationship trends on earth, though still limited by their mating seasons, they learened to pull pleasure from intercorse and now see it as a intimate act.
                Families also now stay together and raise their kids. Marriage is now a concept that exists and same gender ralationships are supported. In Kenova, any realtionship that dose not produce a child is seen
                as useless. 
                <h4>Sammy is influenced more by the culture of Kaar'ka despite being born on Kenova.</h4>
