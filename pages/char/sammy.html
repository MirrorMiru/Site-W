            <h4>
            Sammson Kevia was born to Anieal Kevo and Zzakia Kerria on the dying industreal planet of Kenova during its "Age of Decline". She never met her parents and had 1 sibling (a brother) who she grew to be good freinds with. As soon as she was born, she was taken with him to a "boarding school". She graduated class I at 10yrs, class II at 15, and class III at 20. At 20, she recived a diploma for completion of Teir I schooling and reached adulthood. At 20 she got her workers permit and would begin to work half time in various 
            residential districs as she was never too fond of the factories that dotted the dying planet. Ever since she was a young child she dreamed to leave Kenova, a dream many had as could be seen by the rapidly declining population and mostly elderly or middle aged population. Her brother would move to Kaar'ka, Kenova's sister planet where a majority of the Kenovian race lived, after garduating Tier I. Sammy 
            remained on Kenova and at 40 she graduated Tier III with a Tier III degree in finance and a Tier II degree in mathmatics. By then she could afford a intersystem flight to Heavens Gate, one of the largest cities in this half of the galaxy (space LA), and could even buy out a small apartment room on the First Level (Lower Class (lower # = worse level)). She took the flight at 41. She lived a uninteresting life, at 70, moving to a small house on Level 3. She would occasionally visit Kenova and Kaar'ka, upkeeping a freindly relationship with her brother who had already started a family. (more on Kaar'kan and Kenovian family life on the page for Kenova). At 100 she began to date Miio Kennazo, they would break up 3 years later. Her next lover was Jiima Kenkeno who she would marry at 120 and have 2 children at 130. At 132 she and Jiima decided to move to Kaar'ka. She lived a happy and uneventful life in Kaar'ka. Jiima died at 190, when Sammy was 200. 15 years later, Sammy died from natural causes.
            Sammy's 2 children where Sui Kevia and Korro Kevio. Sui would enlist in the Intergalactic Millitary and be depolyed on the planet Jorumaan, fighting in the Jorumaan war, a war that lasted 5 years and resulted in over 800,000 deaths. She left the war with severe PTSD. She would die at 210 from natural causes and possibly complications caused by the war. Her brother, Korro, would move into Sammy's house on Heavans Gate that was left to him and his sister (she gave her portion of the house to him). He lived there until he was 200, when he died of natural causes.
